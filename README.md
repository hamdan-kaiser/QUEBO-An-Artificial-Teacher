# QUEBO An artificial teacher

 * QUEBO is an android application based on google vision API and made up of two basic architectures-
 * Optical Character Recognition, helps to find and detect alphabets or words from an image.
 * The second one is POS Tagger that detects Parts of speech from a sentence or word.
 * QUEBO only gets alphabets during separation so if only “a” appears, it returns null because this
 * is no part of parts of speech.
